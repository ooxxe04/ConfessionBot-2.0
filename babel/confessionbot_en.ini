message = Hey, I've just been added to {server}! In order for my features to work, you need to go to a channel for anonymous messages and type `{p:global}set`.

[help]
introduction = - **DM me your anonymous messages to have them appear on the server!** *You might be asked to choose a channel if you have access to more than 1 anonymous messages channel.*
	- Admins can use the following commands as long as they start the command with the prefix `{p:local}`{longprefix? *you can also use `{longprefix}`*|}.
	- Mods can use shuffle and ban.
	- Everyone can use `{p:local}list` to get a list of all the channels avaiable to them.
	
	**Still have questions?**
	Get dedicated support from the developer and other users on the [support server]({serverinv}).
bot_description = {c:main/botname} is the most advanced confessions bot on Discord, with mod tools, multiple anonymous messages channels types, image support, and much more!
	To start, `{p:local}set` a anonymous messages channel.
about_field1_title = üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moderation tools
about_field1_value = With the power of anonymous IDs generated for each user (when using a traceable anonymous messages channel), moderators can ban anon-IDs from using bots until the next shuffle if necessary (doesn't mean banning them from the server or kicking them off the server, and moderators won't know who they are), or shuffle anon-IDs if someone is at risk of being found out.
about_field2_title = üí¨ Anonymous messages channel types
about_field2_value = Admins can create anonymous messages channels that are completely untraceable, traceable (for mod tools), vetted (require vetting before being posted publicly), or feedback (can be anonymously sent to without needing to see the resulting anonymous messages).
about_field3_title = üñº Image support
about_field3_value = Images are automatically sent through with anonymous messages by default, which is surprisingly uncommon of a feature in confession bots. *Note, though that there is an NSFW filter forced on by Discord and it can't be disabled*
about_field4_title = üåç Translation support
about_field4_value = {c:main/botname} can be easily translated with the help of the community to other languages, check `{p:local}language` to see existing translations.
about_field5_title = üíµ Even more features with premium
about_field5_value = Support development and hosting costs while also getting some nice perks by going premium. Learn more about premium perks by using `{p:local}premium`.

[confessions]
command_set_help = {p:local}set (none|traceable|untraceable|vetting|feedback)
	eg `{p:local}set traceable`
	Sets a channel for anonymous messages. You need to set the channel type to one of the following;
	- `none`: Don't use this channel.
	- `traceable`: Show anon-ids for each anonymous messages in this channel. Anon-ids make conversations easier to read and enables mods to ban users from send anonymous messages.
	- `untraceable`: Hide anon-ids in this channel. This makes it much more difficult to tell people apart.
	- `vetting`: anonymous messages are sent to this mod channel where they can be approved before being posted publicly. Reveals anon-ids before they go to an untraceable channel.
	- `feedback`: Feedback channels can be posted to even if the user can't see the destination channel. Good for anonymous feedback or reports.
command_list_help = {p:local}list
	Lists all currently available anonymous messages channels on this server.
command_ban_help = {p:local}ban (anon-id)
	Ban any anon-id for using bots (but doesn't mean they are banned or kicked from the server). Bans last until the next time you shuffle ids.
	Unban by putting a minus before their id; `{p:local}ban -abc123`
command_shuffle_help = {p:local}shuffle
	Resets all anon-ids to reduce the chances of one user being tracked and identified. ban expires.
command_imagesupport_help = {p:local}imagesupport [enable|disable]
	Allow images to be sent in anonymous messages. Enabled by default. Disable with `{p:local}imagesupport disable`
command_botmod_help = {p:local}botmod @user
	Promote users in the server to allow them to shuffle anon-ids without being a mod.
	Demote by adding a minus at the start of the mention; `{p:local}botmod - @user`
